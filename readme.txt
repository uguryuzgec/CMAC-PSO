The study integrates the Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) into the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to enhance its performance. Instead of random numbers in the velocity update mechanism, two learning-capable variables are introduced and updated through CMAC training at each iteration. Additionally, a quantization-based initialization method and a new boundary control mechanism are implemented.
